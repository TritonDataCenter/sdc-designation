# Overview

The Designation API's purpose is to respond with the UUID of a compute node on
which to place a new machine or machine reservation. It needs to be passed a
full payload of the machine in question, the server role, IP address required,
dataset required, and quota. (At least)

# Development

To run the boilerplate API server:

    git clone git@git.joyent.com:eng.git
    cd eng
    git submodule update --init
    make all
    node server.js

To update the guidelines, edit "docs/index.restdown" and run `make docs`
to update "docs/index.html".

Before commiting/pushing run `make prepush` and, if possible, get a code
review.



# Testing

    make test

If you project has setup steps necessary for testing, then describe those
here.



# Other Sections Here

Add other sections to your README as necessary. E.g. Running a demo, adding
development data.



# TODO

Remaining work for this repo:

- any "TODO" or "XXX" in the repo
- review from engineering group
- [Trent] Finish the restdown "public" dir and other work as discussed with
  Philip. `git rm docs/media/css`
- Give a little starter guide on using this repo as a starter template for the
  new repos (for NAPI, CNAPI, FWAPI, DAPI, Workflow API, ZAPI). Include
  getting on mo.joyent.com and head.no.de/docs for this.
- Should we spec JIRA projects for the new APIs?
- Add the node/npm local build support a la Amon and DSAPI. I.e. deps/node
  and deps/npm git submodules and build handling in the Makefile.
